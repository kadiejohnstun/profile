                <h1>About Kadie</h1>
                <p>In order of importance: Kadie is a Proud Husband, Father, and United States Marine! </p>
                <h1>Why the name Kadie?</h1>
                <p>Kadie served in the United States Marine Corps for 7 1/2 years. Just after getting back from Iraq in 2003 Kadie hung out in a group that had 3 'Daves' in the group. In order to differentiate between the three the gave each a nickname. For no other reason other than he is a Marine they started to call him 'Killer Dave'. But after two months of calling him 'Killer', Kadie could not get a date to save his life (for some reason people do not want to date a 'Killer'). At this time, Kadie's favorite color became hot pink. In 2003 it was still not cool for a man to wear pink and he started wearing it all the time. His friends to deter him from wearing the color said: 'If you want to wear a woman's color we will give you a woman's name.' And they changed his name to Kadie thinking that he would stop wearing pink. Instead Kadie owned the name and has gone by Kadie ever since.</p>
